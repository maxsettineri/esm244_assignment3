```{r setup, include=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(ggfortify) 
library(patchwork)
library(gghighlight)
library(lubridate)

## PCA

```{r}
## reading in the data
environmental <- read_csv(here('data/world_env_vars.csv')) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% ## dropping rows with NA values
  clean_names()

environmental_clean <- column_to_rownames(environmental, var = 'country') %>% ## using country as row names
  scale() %>% ## scaling data to one standard deviation
  prcomp() ## running the PCA

```
